Scaling laws of creep rupture of fiber bundles (2003, F. Kun)
	Also studies two variations of a model, but uses the ELS/GLS model (and time dependance)

Local load sharing fiber bundles with a lower cutoff of strength disorder (2006, Frank Raischel)
	Very similar!

Text: Among these approaches the so-called fiber bundle model (FBM), widely used to
study materials breakdown phenomena [12, 13, 14], has proven very useful
since it grasps the essential mechanisms of the intermittent failure spreading
yet being simple enough to offer analytic solutions in certain limiting cases
[15, 16, 12].

Text: Recently, two limiting cases
of load sharing have been subject to intensive investigations both with a
high practical relevance: in case of equal load sharing (ELS) all intact fibers
receive the same fraction of load irrespective of their distance from the failed
one, while for localized load sharing (LLS) only the intact nearest neighbors
share equally the load of the broken element [18, 19, 16, 12, 20].

Text: Due to the generality of
this failure spreading mechanism, fibers of the model can easily be replaced
by roads carrying traffic [21, 22], flow channels [23], or electric power stations
[24, 2, 25, 26, 10] on a high voltage transmission grid, making FBMs a basic
modelling framework for cascading failure with widespread applications on
complex networks [14].
